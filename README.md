## ✨ Key Features

### 🛡️ Granular Access & Security Controls
* **Instant Link Revocation:** Disable public access to any active download link immediately from your dashboard without deleting underlying files, with the ability to restore access at any time.
* **Self-Destruct ("Burn After Reading"):** Enables single-use sharing where the file and its database record are atomically and permanently purged immediately upon the first successful download.
* **Max Download Restrictions:** Enforce strict download limits (e.g., max 1, 5, 10 downloads) before links auto-expire.
* **Password Authentication:** Protect sensitive transfers with Bcrypt-hashed password requirements.
* **Automated Expiration:** Customizable expiration windows (1, 3, 7, 30 days) handled automatically via MongoDB TTL background indexing.

### 📊 User Workspace & Real-Time Analytics
* **Interactive Dashboard:** Live summary metrics for Total Files Uploaded, Total Downloads, Active Links, and Storage Footprint.
* **File Management System:** Searchable and filterable vault (`All`, `Active`, `Revoked`, `Expired`) with real-time status indicators.
* **Mobile QR Sharing:** Instant QR code modal generator for sharing files directly to mobile devices.
* **Dual Upload Mode:** Seamless guest uploads for quick sharing or authenticated workspace uploads with persistent management.

### 🎨 Modern UI & Polish
* **Tailwind CSS v3:** Sleek dark glassmorphic design (`#070b14`), glowing accent borders, and Lucide React icons.
* **Drag-and-Drop Uploader:** Multi-file drag and drop uploader with real-time percentage progress bar and preview cards.
* **Responsive Feedback:** Toast notification system for link copying, status toggling, and file actions.
